Final output text:
 

```python
for idx, elem in enumerate(numbers):
    for idx2, elem2 in enumerate(numbers):
        if idx!= idx2:
            distance = abs(elem - elem2)
            if distance < threshold:
                return True
return False
```assistant

```python
def has_close_pair(numbers, threshold):
    for idx, elem in enumerate(numbers):
        for idx2, elem2 in enumerate(numbers):
            if idx!= idx2:
                distance = abs(elem - elem2)
                if distance < threshold:
                    return True
    return False
```assistant

I was asked to complete the code snippet without any extra code or function definitions. Here is the revised answer:

```python
for idx, elem in enumerate(numbers):
    for idx2, elem2 in enumerate(numbers):
        if idx!= idx2:
            distance = abs(elem - elem2)
            if distance < threshold:
                return True
return False
```
